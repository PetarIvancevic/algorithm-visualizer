# Algorithms visualizer
This repository will show various search algorithms so that anyone can see what is going on in the background. The reason for creating this is to expand my understanding of algorithms and try out new things.

Heroku [link](https://alg-visual.herokuapp.com/)

# Overview
I love javascript and testing out new frameworks or design paterns. This is a simple express application which servers `preact` components.
All the algorithms are stored in the `algorithms.js` file and the components simply implement them.

To start the application run
```
npm start
```
To make changes and develop locally use
```
npm run dev
```

# Goals
- Visualize the algorithms in a fun and simple manner
- Add games and explain how they implement the algorithm
- Write documentation which explains each algorithm and the steps it takes
- Machine learning using `js`
- Learn in the progress

# Implemented Algorithms
- Work in progress...

 The [book](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) which I will be using. I highly recommend it if anyone is interested in Artificial Intelligence, AI in `games`, Machine Learning, etc.

If anyone would like to see an algorithm that is not implemented add them to the issues as enhancement. :)
