# Algorithms visualizer
This repository will show various search algorithms so that anyone can see what is going on in the background.

Heroku link will go `here`

# Overview
I love javascript and testing out new frameworks or design paterns. This is a simple express application which servers `preact` components.
All the algorithms are stored in the `algorithms.js` file and the components simply implement them.

To start the application run
```
npm start
```
To make changes and develop locally use
```
npm run dev
```

# Goals
- Visualize the algorithms in a fun and simple manner
- Add games and explain how they implement the algorithm
- Write documentation which explains each algorithm and the steps it takes
- Machine learning using `js`
- Learn in the progress

# Implemented Algorithms
- Work in progress...

 The [book](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) which I will be using. I highly recommend it if anyone is interested in Artificial Intelligence, AI in `games`, Machine Learning, etc.

If anyone would like to see an algorithm that is not implemented add them to the issues as enhancement. :)
